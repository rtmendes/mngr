Every workspace package's wheel build now excludes test files uniformly via:

```
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
exclude = ["*_test.py", "test_*.py", "**/conftest.py", "**/testing.py"]
```

Previously, several packages were missing some or all of these patterns, so hatchling shipped `_test.py`, `conftest.py`, and `testing.py` files into the published wheels (e.g. `libs/mngr` was leaking `cli/testing.py`, `api/testing.py`, and `providers/docker/testing.py` because its existing pattern only covered `**/utils/testing.py`).

A new meta ratchet (`test_every_project_excludes_tests_from_wheel`) enforces the four-pattern rule on every project so this cannot regress.
