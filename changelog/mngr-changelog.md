Added a changelog system for tracking changes across PRs:
- Per-PR changelog entry files in `changelog/` directory, enforced by CI via meta ratchet test
- Nightly automated consolidation of changelog entries into `CHANGELOG.md`
- Idempotent setup script for the consolidation agent (`scripts/setup_changelog_agent.sh`)
