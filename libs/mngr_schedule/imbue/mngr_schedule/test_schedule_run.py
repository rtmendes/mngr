"""Release test for mngr schedule run with Modal deployment.

This test requires Modal credentials and network access. It is marked
with @pytest.mark.release and @pytest.mark.timeout(900).

End-to-end flow:
1. Deploy a trigger via schedule add (with --verify none for speed)
2. Run it immediately via schedule run --provider modal
3. Verify it completed successfully
4. Cleanup: stop/delete the deployed Modal app
