"""Thread-local resource cleanup for ConcurrencyGroupExecutor threads.

Pyinfra uses gevent greenlets for reading subprocess output. Each thread that
touches gevent gets its own Hub with an OS-level pipe for event-loop wakeups.
Without explicit cleanup, that pipe leaks when the thread exits.

This module provides a cleanup function registered as the global default
``on_thread_exit`` callback via ``set_default_on_thread_exit``.
