"""Test script for verifying kqueue + tty compatibility.

This script is NOT imported as a module -- it is read as a resource file
by test_urwid_tty.py and executed in a tmux session to verify that the
resolved tty path works with macOS kqueue in both piped-stdin and
direct-stdin contexts.

The sentinel ``URWID_TTY_TEST_DONE`` is printed at the end so the test
harness knows when execution has finished.
