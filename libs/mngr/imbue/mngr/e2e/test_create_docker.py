"""Tests for Docker agent creation from the tutorial.

The tests are intentionally kept as separate functions (not parametrized) so that
each one has a 1:1 correspondence with a tutorial script block. This makes it
easy to maintain the mapping between tutorial content and test coverage via the
tutorial_matcher script.
