"""Shared pytest conftest hooks for all projects in the monorepo.

Provides common test infrastructure:
- Global test locking (prevents parallel pytest processes from conflicting)
- Test suite timing limits (configurable via PYTEST_MAX_DURATION env var)
- xdist parallelism override (configurable via PYTEST_NUMPROCESSES env var)
- Output file redirection (slow tests report, coverage report)
- Shared pytest defaults (markers, filterwarnings, CLI args, coverage report config)
- Resource mark enforcement (ensures tests are correctly marked for external tool usage)

Environment variables:
- PYTEST_NUMPROCESSES: Override the number of xdist workers (default: 4, set in
  pyproject.toml addopts). Set to e.g. 16 on machines with many cores, or 0 to
  disable xdist. This overrides the -n value from pyproject.toml but NOT an
  explicit -n passed on the command line.
- PYTEST_MAX_DURATION: Override the maximum allowed test suite duration in seconds.
  Without this, defaults are chosen based on test type and environment (see
  _pytest_sessionfinish for details).

Usage in each project's conftest.py:
    from imbue.imbue_common.conftest_hooks import register_conftest_hooks
    register_conftest_hooks(globals())

The register_conftest_hooks function uses a module-level guard to ensure hooks
are only registered once. This is critical because when running from the monorepo
root, both the root conftest.py AND per-project conftest.py files are discovered
by pytest. Without the guard, pytest_addoption would fail with duplicate option errors.
