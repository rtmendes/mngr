# mngr_forward

Auth + subdomain-forwarding plugin for `mngr`.

`mngr forward` runs a local proxy that serves
`<agent-id>.localhost:<port>/*` and byte-forwards each request to a service
URL discovered for that agent (`--service NAME`, the default workflow) or
a fixed remote port (`--port REMOTE_PORT`, manual mode). Remote agents are
reached via a per-host SSH tunnel (Unix-domain socket on the local side,
paramiko `direct-tcpip` channel on the SSH side).

The plugin is opt-in:

```bash
mngr plugin enable forward
mngr forward --service system_interface
```

## Quick start (browser user)

```bash
mngr forward --service system_interface --open-browser
```

This:

1. Spawns `mngr observe --discovery-only` and per-agent `mngr event --follow`
   subprocesses. Their lines pass through to stdout as a merged JSONL stream
   wrapped in a `{stream, agent_id?, payload}` envelope so consumers can drive
   their own state from a single stream.
2. Listens on `127.0.0.1:8421` and prints a one-time login URL to stderr (or
   emits a `login_url` JSONL event on stdout in `--format jsonl`).
3. After the browser visits the login URL, future navigations to
   `agent-<hex>.localhost:8421/` are byte-forwarded to that agent's resolved
   `system_interface` URL through an SSH tunnel.

## Reverse tunnels

`--reverse <remote-port>:<local-port>` (repeatable) auto-sets up reverse SSH
tunnels for every known agent on a remote host. The `<remote-port>` may be
`0` to ask sshd for a dynamic assignment; the actual bound port is reported
in a `forward.reverse_tunnel_established` envelope event.

## Manual mode

`--no-observe --port REMOTE_PORT` runs `mngr list --format jsonl` once and
forwards a fixed snapshot. `--no-observe` is invalid with `--service NAME`.

## Sub-process integration

Consumers (notably `minds run`) can spawn `mngr forward --format jsonl
--preauth-cookie <opaque-token>`, parse the envelope JSONL stream off
stdout, and pre-set the `mngr_forward_session` cookie in their browser
session so the OTP flow is bypassed.

`SIGHUP` bounces only the `mngr observe` child subprocess; SSH tunnels,
per-agent event subprocesses, browser sessions, and the FastAPI app stay
alive. Used by `minds run` to make a freshly-written
`[providers.imbue_cloud_<slug>]` block in `settings.toml` take effect.

## On-disk state

`$MNGR_HOST_DIR/plugin/forward/signing_key` (cookie HMAC key, generated once
on first run, persisted across restarts so previously-issued cookies still
verify).

OTPs are kept in-memory only and do not survive a restart.

## Status

Experimental. See `specs/mngr-forward-plugin/spec.md`.
