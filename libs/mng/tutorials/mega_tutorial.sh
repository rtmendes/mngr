##############################################################################
# CREATING AGENTS
#   One of the most common things you'll want to do with mng is create agents. There are *tons* of options,
#   so basically any workflow you want should be supported.
##############################################################################

## BASIC CREATION

# running mng create is strictly better than running claude! It's less letters to type :-D
# running this command launches claude (Claude Code) immediately *in a new worktree*
mng create
# the defaults are the following: agent=claude, provider=local, project=current dir

# if you want the default behavior of claude (starting in-place), you can specify that:
mng create --in-place
# mng defaults to creating a new worktree for each agent because the whole point of mng is to let you run multiple agents in parallel.
# without creating a new worktree for each, they will make conflicting changes with one another.

# when creating agents to accomplish tasks, it's recommended that you give them a name to make it easier to manage them:
mng create my-task
# that command give the agent a name of "my-task". If you don't specify a name, mng will generate a random one for you.

# you can use a short form for most commands (like create) as well--the above command is the same as these:
mng create my-task claude
mng c my-task

# for the rest of this doc, we'll use the explicit form (specifying "create") just to be extra clear,
# but you might want to use the short form in your day-to-day work for speed and convenience.
# you can (and should) create aliases and templated as well (see TEMPLATES, ALIASES, AND SHORTCUTS below)

# you can also specify a different agent (ex: codex)
mng create my-task codex

# you can specify the arguments to the *agent* (ie, send args to claude rather than mng)
# by using `--` to separate the agent arguments from the mng arguments:
mng create my-task -- --model opus
# that command launches claude with the "opus" model instead of the default

# you can also launch claude remotely in Modal:
mng create my-task --provider modal
# see more details below in "CREATING AGENTS REMOTELY" for relevant options

# you can run *any* literal command instead of a named agent type:
mng create my-task --command python -- my_script.py
# remember that the arguments to the "agent" (or command) come after the `--` separator

# this enables some pretty interesting use cases, like running servers or other programs (besides AI agents)
# this make debugging easy--you can snapshot when a task is complete, then later connect to that exact machine state:
mng create my-task --command python --idle-mode run --idle-timeout 60 -- my_long_running_script.py extra-args
# see "RUNNING NON-AGENT PROCESSES" below for more details

# alternatively, you can simply add extra tmux windows that run alongside your agent:
mng create my-task -w server="npm run dev" -w logs="tail -f app.log"
# that command automatically starts two tmux windows named "server" and "logs" that run those commands (in addition to the main window that runs the agent)

## SENDING MESSAGES ON LAUNCH

# you can send an initial message (so you don't have to wait around, eg, while a Modal container starts)
mng create my-task --provider modal --no-connect --message "Speed up one of my tests and make a PR on github"
# here we disable the default --connect behavior (because presumably you just wanted to launch that in the background and continue on your way)
# and then we also pass in an explicit message for the agent to start working on immediately
# the message can also be specified as the contents of a file (by using --message-file instead of --message)

# you can also edit the message *while the agent is starting up*, which is very handy for making it "feel" instant:
mng create my-task --provider modal --edit-message

## SPECIFYING DATA FOR THE AGENT

# by default, the agent uses the data from its current git repo (if any) or folder, but you can specify a different source:
mng create my-task --source-path /path/to/some/other/project

# similarly, by default the agent is tagged with a "project" label that matches the name of the current git repo (or folder), but you can specify a different project:
mng create my-task --project my-project

# mng doesn't require git at all--if there's no git repo, it will just use the files from the folder as the source data
mkdir -p /tmp/my_random_folder
echo "print('hello world')" > /tmp/my_random_folder/script.py
mng create my-task --source-path /tmp/my_random_folder --command python -- script.py

# however, if you do use git, mng makes that convenient
# by default, it creates a new git branch for each agent (so that their changes don't conflict with each other):
mng create my-task
git branch | grep mng/my-task

# --branch controls branch creation. the default is :mng/* which creates a new branch named mng/{agent_name}
# you can change the pattern (the * is replaced by the agent name):
mng create my-task --branch ":feature/*"
git branch | grep feature/my-task

# you can also specify a different base branch (instead of the current branch):
mng create my-task --branch "main:mng/*"

# or set the new branch name explicitly:
mng create my-task --branch ":feature/my-task"

# you can create a copy instead of a worktree:
mng create my-task --copy
# that is used by default if you're not in a git repo

# you can disable new branch creation entirely by omitting the :NEW part (requires --in-place or --copy due to how worktrees work, and --in-place implies no new branch):
mng create my-task --copy --branch main

# you can create a "clone" instead of worktree or copy, which is a lightweight copy that shares git objects with the original repo but has its own separate working directory:
mng create my-task --clone

# you can make a shallow clone for faster setup:
mng create my-task --depth 1
# (--shallow-since clones since a specific date instead)

# you can clone from an existing agent's work directory:
mng create my-task --from other-agent
# (--source, --source-agent, and --source-host are alternative forms for more specific control)

# you can use rsync to transfer extra data as well, beyond just the git data:
mng create my-task --provider modal --rsync --rsync-args "--exclude=node_modules"

## CREATING AGENTS REMOTELY

# one of the coolest features of mng is the ability to create agents on remote hosts just as easily as you can create them locally:
mng create my-task --provider modal -- --dangerously-skip-permissions --append-system-prompt "Don't ask me any questions!"
# that command passes the "--dangerously-skip-permissions" flag to claude because it's safe to do so:
# agents running remotely are running in a sandboxed environment where they can't really mess anything up on their local machine (or if they do, it doesn't matter)
# because it's running remotely, you might also want something like that system prompt (to tell it not to get blocked on you)

# running agents remotely is really cool because you can create an unlimited number of them, but it comes with some downsides
# one of the main downsides is cost--remote hosts aren't free, and if you forget about them, they can rack up a big bill.
# mng makes it really easy to deal with this by automatically shutting down hosts when their agents are idle:
mng create my-task --provider modal --idle-timeout 60
# that command shuts down the Modal host (and agent) after 1 minute of inactivity.

# You can customize what "inactivity" means by using the --idle-mode flag:
mng create my-task --provider modal --idle-mode "ssh"
# that command will only consider agents as "idle" when you are not connected to them
# see the idle_detection.md file for more details on idle detection and timeouts

# you can specify which existing host to run on using the address syntax (eg, if you have multiple Modal hosts or SSH servers):
mng create my-task@my-dev-box

# generally though, you'll want to construct a new Modal host for each agent.
# build arguments let you customize that new remote host (eg, GPU type, memory, base Docker image for Modal):
mng create my-task --provider modal -b cpu=4 -b memory=16 -b image=python:3.12
# see "mng create --help" for all provider-specific build args
# some other useful Modal build args: --region, --timeout, --offline (blocks network), --secret, --cidr-allowlist, --context-dir

# the most important build args for Modal are probably "--file" and "--context-dir",
# which let you specify a custom Dockerfile and build context directory (respectively) for building the host environment.
# This is how you can get custom dependencies, files, and setup steps on your Modal hosts. For example:
mng create my-task --provider modal -b file=./Dockerfile.agent -b context-dir=./agent-context
# that command builds a Modal host using the Dockerfile at ./Dockerfile.agent and the build context at ./agent-context
# (which is where the Dockerfile can COPY files from, and also where build args are evaluated from)

# you can name the host using the address syntax:
mng create my-task@my-modal-box.modal --new-host
# (--host-name-style and --name-style control auto-generated name styles for hosts and agents respectively)

# you can mount persistent Modal volumes in order to share data between hosts, or have it be available even when they are offline (or after they are destroyed):
mng create my-task --provider modal -b volume=my-data:/data

# you can use an existing snapshot instead of building a new host from scratch:
mng create my-task --provider modal --snapshot snap-123abc

# some providers (like docker), take "start" args as well as build args:
mng create my-task --provider docker -s "--gpus all"
# these args are passed to "docker run", whereas the build args are passed to "docker build".

# you can specify the target path where the agent's work directory will be mounted:
mng create my-task --provider modal --target-path /workspace

# you can upload files and run custom commands during host provisioning:
mng create my-task --provider modal --upload-file ~/.ssh/config:/root/.ssh/config --extra-provision-command "pip install foo"
# (--append-to-file and --prepend-to-file are also available)

# by default, agents are started when a host is booted. This can be disabled:
mng create my-task --provider modal --no-start-on-boot
# but it only makes sense to do this if you are running multiple agents on the same host
# that's because hosts are automatically stopped when they have no more running agents, so you have to have at least one.

## CONTROLLING THE AGENT ENVIRONMENT

# you can set environment variables for the agent:
mng create my-task --env DEBUG=true
# (--env-file loads from a file, --pass-env forwards a variable from your current shell)

# it is *strongly encouraged* to use either use --env-file or --pass-env, especially for any sensitive environment variables (like API keys) rather than --env, because that way they won't end up in your shell history or in your config files by accident. For example:
export API_KEY=abc123
mng create my-task --pass-env API_KEY
# that command passes the API_KEY environment variable from your current shell into the agent's environment, without you having to specify the value on the command line.

# you can also set host-level environment variables (separate from agent env vars):
mng create my-task --provider modal --pass-host-env MY_VAR
# --host-env-file and --pass-host-env work the same as their agent counterparts, and again, you should generally prefer those forms (but if you really need to you can use --host-env to specify host env vars directly)

## TEMPLATES, ALIASES, AND SHORTCUTS

# you can use templates to quickly apply a set of preconfigured options:
echo '[create_templates.my_modal_template]' >> .mng/settings.local.toml
echo 'provider = "modal"' >> .mng/settings.local.toml
echo 'build_args = "cpu=4"' >> .mng/settings.local.toml
mng create my-task --template my_modal_template
# templates are defined in your config (see the CONFIGURATION section for more) and can be stacked: --template modal --template codex
# templates take exactly the same parameters as the create command
# -t is short for --template. Many commands have a short form (see the "--help")

# you can enable or disable specific plugins:
mng create my-task --plugin my-plugin --disable-plugin other-plugin

# you should probably use aliases for making little shortcuts for yourself, because many of the commands can get a bit long:
echo "alias mc='mng create --in-place'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
# or use a more sophisticated tool, like Espanso

## TIPS AND TRICKS

# by default, mng aborts the create command if the working tree has uncommitted changes. You can avoid this by doing:
mng create my-task --no-ensure-clean
# this is particularly useful for starting agents when, eg, you are in the middle of a merge conflict and you just want the agent to finish it off, for example
# it should probably be avoided in general, because it makes it more difficult to merge work later.

# another handy trick is to make the create command "idempotent" so that you don't need to worry about remembering whether you created an agent yet or not:
mng create sisyphus --reuse --provider modal
# if that agent already exists, it will be reused (and started) instead of creating a new one. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.

# you can control connection retries and timeouts:
mng create my-task --provider modal --retry 5 --retry-delay 10s
# (--reconnect / --no-reconnect controls auto-reconnect on disconnect)

# you can use a custom connect command instead of the default (eg, useful for, say, connecting in a new iterm window instead of the current one)
mng create my-task --connect-command "my_script.sh"

# you can add labels to organize your agents and tags for host metadata:
mng create my-task --label team=backend --host-label env=staging

## CREATING AND USING AGENTS PROGRAMMATICALLY

# mng is very much meant to be used for scripting and automation, so nothing requires interactivity.
# if you want to be sure that interactivity is disabled, you can use the --headless flag:
mng create my-task --headless

# or you can set that option in your config so that it always applies:
mng config set headless true

# or you can set it as an environment variable:
export MNG_HEADLESS=true

# *all* mng options work like that. For example, if you want to always run agents in Modal by default, you can set that in your config:
mng config set commands.create.provider modal
# for more on configuration, see the CONFIGURATION section below

# you can control output format for scripting:
mng create my-task --no-connect --format json
# (--quiet suppresses all output)

# you can send a message when starting the agent (great for scripting):
mng create my-task --no-connect --message "Do the thing"
