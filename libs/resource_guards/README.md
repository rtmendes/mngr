# resource-guards

Pytest infrastructure for enforcing that tests declare their external resource usage via marks.

Resource guards catch two classes of bugs:

- **Missing marks**: a test calls an external resource without the corresponding `@pytest.mark.<resource>`. The guard fails the test with a clear message.
- **Superfluous marks**: a test carries a resource mark but never actually invokes the resource. The guard fails the test so the mark doesn't rot.

## How it works

There are two guard mechanisms, covering CLI binaries and Python SDKs respectively.

**Binary guards** create wrapper scripts that shadow the real binary on `PATH`. During a test, the wrapper checks environment variables to decide whether the test is allowed to use the binary. If not, it records a tracking file and exits 127. If yes, it records a tracking file and delegates to the real binary.

**SDK guards** monkeypatch a chokepoint in a Python SDK. The monkeypatched function calls `enforce_sdk_guard()`, which checks the same environment variables and either raises `ResourceGuardViolation` or records a tracking file.

Both mechanisms use per-test tracking files so the `makereport` hook can detect violations even when the test swallows errors or handles non-zero exit codes.

## Setup

In your `conftest.py`, register each resource you want to guard with `register_resource_guard()`, then add `pytest_configure`, `pytest_sessionstart`, and `pytest_sessionfinish` hooks as shown below. `register_guarded_resource_markers` registers the pytest marks for all guarded resources in one call.

```python
# conftest.py
from imbue.resource_guards.resource_guards import (
    register_guarded_resource_markers,
    register_resource_guard,
    start_resource_guards,
    stop_resource_guards,
)

register_resource_guard("tmux")
register_resource_guard("rsync")

def pytest_configure(config):
    register_guarded_resource_markers(config)

def pytest_sessionstart(session):
    start_resource_guards(session)

def pytest_sessionfinish(session, exitstatus):
    stop_resource_guards()
```

Then mark your tests:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.tmux
def test_agent_creates_tmux_session():
    ...
```

## Discovering guards from installed packages

Multi-package projects can advertise their guards through the `imbue_resource_guards` entry point group instead of having every consumer's `conftest.py` re-list them. Each entry point's value is a callable that takes no arguments and registers one or more guards via `register_resource_guard()` and/or `register_sdk_guard()`/`create_sdk_method_guard()`. Call `register_all_resource_guards()` once before installing the pytest hooks to invoke every callable in the group.

```toml
# library's pyproject.toml
[project.entry-points.imbue_resource_guards]
my_lib = "imbue.my_lib.register_guards:register_my_guard"
```

```python
# library's register_guards.py
from imbue.resource_guards.resource_guards import register_resource_guard

def register_my_guard():
    register_resource_guard("my_tool")
```

```python
# consumer's conftest.py
from imbue.resource_guards.resource_guards import (
    register_all_resource_guards,
    register_guarded_resource_markers,
    start_resource_guards,
    stop_resource_guards,
)

register_all_resource_guards()  # imports + invokes every entry point in the group

def pytest_configure(config):
    register_guarded_resource_markers(config)

def pytest_sessionstart(session):
    start_resource_guards(session)

def pytest_sessionfinish(session, exitstatus):
    stop_resource_guards()
```

The library that owns a tool is the natural place to declare its guard, and consumers don't need to know which guards exist in advance.

## Writing a custom SDK guard

You can guard any Python SDK by registering an install/cleanup pair:

```python
from imbue.resource_guards.resource_guards import enforce_sdk_guard
from imbue.resource_guards.resource_guards import register_sdk_guard

_originals = {}

def _install():
    _originals["send"] = SomeClient.send
    SomeClient.send = _guarded_send

def _cleanup():
    if "send" in _originals:
        SomeClient.send = _originals["send"]
        _originals.clear()

def _guarded_send(self, *args, **kwargs):
    enforce_sdk_guard("my_sdk")
    return _originals["send"](self, *args, **kwargs)

register_sdk_guard("my_sdk", _install, _cleanup)
```

The key requirement is that your monkeypatch calls `enforce_sdk_guard("my_sdk")` at the SDK's chokepoint -- the single method through which all external calls flow.

## Compatibility with pytest-xdist

Binary guards work transparently with xdist. The controller process creates the wrapper scripts and modifies `PATH`; workers inherit both via environment variables. SDK guards are installed independently in each process (controller and workers), since monkeypatches are process-local.
