"""On-disk persistence for per-agent Latchkey permission rules.

Each minds-managed agent gets its own ``permissions.json`` file on the
desktop host. The corresponding ``latchkey gateway`` subprocess reads it
via ``LATCHKEY_PERMISSIONS_CONFIG``, so any rule edits made here take
effect on the next request that gateway proxies.

The file format is the one defined by the Detent library (which Latchkey
uses for permission checks): a top-level object with optional ``schemas``,
``rules`` and ``include`` keys. We do not parse schemas or include paths --
we only manage rules whose key is one of the scope schemas a service owns,
preserving any unrelated keys verbatim on round-trip.
