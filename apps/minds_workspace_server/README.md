# Minds Workspace Server

Web chat interface for viewing and interacting with mngr-managed Claude agents.

Shows live conversations from Claude session files in a web UI, with real-time
updates via Server-Sent Events.

## Usage

```bash
minds-workspace-server
```

Opens at http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default.

## Development

uv run minds-workspace-server

# Frontend (with hot reload)
cd apps/minds_workspace_server/frontend
npm install
