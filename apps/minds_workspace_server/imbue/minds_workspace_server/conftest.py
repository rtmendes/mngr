# --- pytest-playwright fixture-scope overrides -------------------------------
#
# pytest-playwright (installed as a plugin) ships these fixtures at SESSION
# scope: `playwright` (the sync_playwright handle, which spawns the node
# driver subprocess), `browser_type`, `browser_type_launch_args`,
# `connect_options`, and `browser` (the actual chromium/firefox process).
# Session-scope means teardown runs at pytest session end -- AFTER mngr's
# autouse `session_cleanup` fixture (libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/conftest.py) has
# already checked for leaked child processes. In offload release batches
# that mix workspace-server e2e tests with other mngr tests, both the
# playwright node driver and chrome-headless-shell are still alive when
# session_cleanup runs, so it asserts "leftover child processes" and
# cascades a teardown error into every sibling test in the batch
# (test_install.py, test_help.py, test_release_vultr, etc.).
#
# The fix is to force the entire fixture chain down to function scope so
# each test's playwright+chrome teardown finishes inside its own pytest
# teardown. Cost: a second or so per test to re-spawn the driver+browser;
# trivial for the tiny e2e suite here.
#
# All four session-scoped fixtures must be overridden together because
# pytest forbids a session-scope fixture from depending on a function-scope
# one ("ScopeMismatch"). Overriding `browser` alone would leave
# `browser_type` at session scope and trip that check.
