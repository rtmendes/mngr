You are running as a nightly changelog consolidation automation inside an
ephemeral Modal sandbox. The schedule creates a fresh worktree at
`$MNGR_AGENT_WORK_DIR` with a per-run branch (`mngr/changelog-consolidation-
<timestamp>`) checked out — that is the directory you must operate in.
The deployed-code root at `/code/project` is on detached HEAD and is NOT
the right place to commit. Execute the following steps in order, exactly.
Do not deviate. Do not ask questions. If any step fails, capture the
failure detail in `status.json` (see step 10) and exit non-zero.

1. `cd "$MNGR_AGENT_WORK_DIR"`. Verify with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref
   HEAD` that you are on a `mngr/changelog-consolidation-*` branch (not
   `HEAD`). If you are on detached HEAD, that means the schedule
   topology has drifted from the assumption above; write `status.json`
   with `status: failed` and the captured `pwd` + branch state in
   `notes`, then exit non-zero.

2. Run `python3 scripts/consolidate_changelog.py`. Capture stdout. If stdout
   contains the literal string "No changelog entries", write `status.json`
   with `{"status": "skipped-no-entries", "pr_url": null, "notes": ""}` and
   exit 0.

3. Read `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md`. Find the most recent date section
   (heading matching `## YYYY-MM-DD`). Extract the date string and the
   bullet content under it.

4. Generate a concise, human-friendly summary of that section: a few markdown
   bullets, no preamble, no trailing prose. Group related changes. Use natural
   language.

5. Insert the summary into `CHANGELOG.md` under the same date heading,
   immediately above any prior date sections (so dates remain in
   reverse-chronological order). Preserve the existing file header.

6. Configure git: `git config user.email "changelog-bot@imbue.com"`,
   `git config user.name "Changelog Bot"`, `gh auth setup-git`.

7. `git add -A` and `git commit -m "Consolidate changelog entries for <date>"`,
   substituting the date from step 3.

8. The scheduled `mngr create` already placed this agent on a per-run
   branch named `mngr/changelog-consolidation-<timestamp>` (created by the
   `--branch ':mngr/changelog-consolidation-{DATE}'` flag in
   `scripts/setup_changelog_agent.sh`). Capture that branch name with
   `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` and push it to origin with
   `git push --set-upstream origin <branch>`. Do not create a second
   branch.

9. Do NOT run `gh pr create`. PR creation is intentionally disabled until
   these scripts have landed on `main` (chicken-and-egg: opening real PRs
   from a dev-branch consolidation would spam the repo). To re-enable PR
   creation later, replace this step with: `gh pr create --base main
   --title "Changelog consolidation <date>" --body "Automated changelog
   consolidation for <date>."`, capturing stdout-only into a `pr_url`
   variable (stderr has progress lines that would corrupt the JSON below
   if folded in via `2>&1`). See the BEFORE-MERGE TODO at the bottom of
   this prompt.

10. Write `status.json` to `$MNGR_AGENT_STATE_DIR/status.json` with this
    schema (all keys required):
    - `status`: one of `"done"` (success path), `"skipped-no-entries"`
      (step 2 short-circuit), or `"failed"` (any step failed)
    - `pr_url`: string PR URL if a PR was created, else `null` (currently
      always `null` since step 9 is disabled)
    - `notes`: freeform human-readable string. On success: short note
      like `"Pushed branch <branch>; PR creation disabled."` where
      `<branch>` is the value captured from `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref
      HEAD` in step 8. On failure: which step failed and the error
      detail. Multi-line OK.

11. Exit 0 on success, non-zero on any failure.

# BEFORE-MERGE TODOs

These two changes must be made before this PR (the changelog system itself)
lands on `main`, but cannot be tested end-to-end until then:

1. **Switch step 7's commit base to `origin/main`** so consolidation PRs
   contain ONLY changelog changes, not every diff on the dev branch the
   container was deployed from. Sketch: between steps 2 and 5, stash the
   resulting `CHANGELOG.md` / `UNABRIDGED_CHANGELOG.md` / changelog/
   deletions; capture the current branch with `BRANCH=$(git rev-parse
   --abbrev-ref HEAD)`; `git fetch origin main && git checkout -B
   "$BRANCH" origin/main`; re-apply the stashed changes; then continue
   from step 5.

2. **Re-enable real PR creation in step 9** as described above. Capture
   stdout-only for the `pr_url` value (stderr has progress lines that
   would corrupt status.json if folded in via `2>&1`).

Both are blocked on these scripts being on `main`: (1) would branch off a
main that doesn't yet contain `consolidate_changelog.py`, and (2) would
spam real PRs on every deploy-trigger cycle during iteration.
